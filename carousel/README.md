This portfolio is a responsive site showcasing a sampling of projects and skills
that were developed during my coding bootcamp in late 2017.  

All the images serve as links: linkedin, github, email, and the projects.  

There are many projects I'm proud of, and all are still in development, but I chose
a few to highlight some of my favorite skills:  javascript, handlebars, sql, and php.
